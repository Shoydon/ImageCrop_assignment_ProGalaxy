# ImageCrop_assignment_ProGalaxy

Problem statement:

create a simple front end web page and demonstrate image crop and resize

functionality using html, js and css. - provide a button for user to browse and select a png/jpeg file from their local hard drive

display image preview with original dimensions (width x height in pixels) - provide controls for user to crop the image (select part of the image). cropped image shall be displayed separately with it's dimensions. - provide controls for user to resize the cropped image (change width and height. example: 817x644px to 512x512px). image distortion (stretch/squeeze) is expected. resized image shall be displayed separately, do not hard-code the resized dimensions, user should be able to choose whatever final dimensions they want.

no need to save / upload the edited image. front end only.
